They also believe in developing talent across the practice so being willing to share your skills and lead by example is essential.<BR><BR>Join a company with over 100 years’ experience providing expert care for sick and injured pets! Focusing on measuring impact rather than hitting targets. To achieve this balance effectively, support is key and there is always the opportunity to share complex cases and discuss treatment plans and outcomes with all team members, including both highly experience surgeons and those new to the profession.<BR><BR>Cardiff has something for everyone! Feel your heart race at the international white water centre, discover 2000 years of history within its castle, shop until you drop in a centre full of top brands and thriving independent shops, or perhaps join in its buzzing music, arts, and foodie scene, or maybe soak up the atmosphere and the Welsh passion for rugby at its Principality stadium, or even head-out of the city to explore 185 miles of National Parks, fairy-tale castles, snow-capped peaks and coastal paths.<BR><BR>The hospital is on the peripheral of the city and inside you’ll find a hive of veterinary activity along with a warm Welsh welcome.

The hospital covers its own OOHs (but they ensure you have sufficient down-time post OOH so that work-life balance remains positive). Their working hours are 8am-8pm but most typically shifts will be either 8am-4:30pm or 9am-5:30pm (but shifts could be any variation between 8am-8pm). However, they can be super flexible around working hours, days, patterns – when asked they will look to accommodate your needs alongside their own.<BR><BR>They understand the importance of growth and development, and how it can mean different things to different people. You will always be supported on this journey, whether it be developing clinical skills or working towards management goals.

        "description": "Emillies client in Shropshire is looking for someone to bring new ideas into the fold, sharing and developing their veterinary experience within the team to strengthen what the practice has to offer. If you’re a farm vet looking for the next step in your career, this might be the role for you!<BR><BR>•\tFull-time Farm Vet role<BR>•\t1 in 10 OOH rota, with options to buy and sell OOH work to increase flexibility<BR>•\t2 years’ experience preferred<BR>•\tIdeally, you’ll have experience in handling OOHs cases and a solid base of surgical skills.<BR>•\tChance to work amongst 30 experienced vets, sharing experience!<BR><BR>This role is great from someone looking to grow, learning from an experienced team while developing their own interests through training and hands on experience!<BR>They value vets who like to challenge the status quo and don’t believe in standing still: not everything they attempt will work, but they believe in experimenting and learning from times of failure. The practice will support projects you think will positively impact the team and clients, in hope you can share unique perspectives gained in previous roles.<BR><BR>Creating great client relationships is imperative. You must want to build on these with the farmers during routine dairy herd health work. A good understanding of cattle reproduction and ultrasound is needed to help conversation flow, as they would like you to get involved immediately. Opportunities to work with the wider client-base can be developed through discussion and benchmarking groups as well as health planning.<BR><BR>They believe that sharing is caring – the farmers benefit from having two vets involved on their farm, and communication between vets (as well as with farmers) is an essential skill. You’ll be working with 30-strong team members, including 12 clinical vets, with strong team ethos and a collaborative approach.<BR><BR>Hard work shouldn’t be something to be afraid of, they’re seeking someone who wants to get stuck in from the start, joining their 1 in 10 rota and covering the day-to-day emergencies of a busy dairy-focused practice. You should be confident in handling cases out-of-hours and have a solid base of surgical skills (this is expected), typical of those with at least 2 years’ experience of farm vetting under their belt. The practice is also involved in vet school teaching, farmer training, product and germplasm export and sheep / cattle AI & embryo transfer – and are always keen to support those looking to develop in these areas.<BR><BR>If this sounds like a role that would suit you, please still get in touch. More importantly, they are looking for someone who is enthusiastic, enjoys working as a team and is a problem solver. Ideally, they are seeking a full-time vet to join our team, but for the right person they will be flexible with days / hours.<BR><BR>Founded in 1999, as the first farm animal only vet practice in the UK, growing to a multi-site business with more than 30 vets working in their practices. They continue to deliver expertise to clients across the country. They have a very close team with a social culture and strong core values; positivity, proactivity, innovation and integrity, empathy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The team consists of experienced farm clinicians, Vet techs, TB Vets, approved TB testers, embryo transfer specialists and a brilliant support team who keep everything ticking. <BR> <BR>You can expect benefits of:<BR>•\tAttractive remuneration package<BR>•\t1 in 10 OOH rota, with options to buy and sell OOH work to increase flexibility<BR>•\t25 days holiday plus bank holidays with additional days in lieu for weekends on call<BR>•\tVehicle provided, or allowance<BR>•\tMinimal TB testing, due to having an experienced TB team<BR>•\tFlexible CPD allowance<BR>•\tHealth Shield cash plan<BR>•\tPrivate medical insurance (after a year’s service)<BR>•\tOne volunteering day per year<BR><BR>If you like the sound of this role, please send your CV to Emillie or call on: 01395 200189 / Emillie.Loaring@SynergyVets.com<BR>",

However, they would also be happy to support teaching of a candidate with a solid foundation in surgical techniques who wishes to learn new orthopaedic procedures, as the practice has a visiting RCVS advanced practitioner in surgery, endoscopy and endosurgery available to assist/support if needed.

This scheme focuses on ensuring workplaces support colleagues across a wide range of areas. An exciting scheme to be taking part in, they are committed to working with the BVA to work towards accreditation – not just about an award but truly learning from the process to ensure that they provide the best possible work environment.<BR><BR>They are appreciative of supporting a good work-life balance as well as the importance of job satisfaction – and really strive to ensure all the team feel fulfilled in their career, as well as being able to enjoy and cherish their free time out of work.

This role is available on a full or part-time basis, with a salary of £40,000–£65,000 pro rata depending on experience. If you’re looking for a position where you’ll feel genuinely supported, have room to grow and enjoy a great mix of clinical work, this could be the perfect next step.<BR><BR>The practice has been part of the local community for many years and is proud to offer high-quality first-opinion veterinary care across multiple sites in the area. Their small animal team sees a varied and interesting caseload, making the role ideal for an experienced vet who enjoys developing their skills, especially if you have an interest in surgery or orthopaedics.<BR><BR>The team is warm, welcoming and very supportive. They put a lot of effort into making sure colleagues feel appreciated, with regular wellbeing check-ins and a focus on creating a happy, positive working environment. The team also enjoys getting involved in local events and charity activities, from community days to sponsored walks and fun runs.<BR><BR>The full-time rota is 40 hours a week, with 1 in 8 weekends on call and one weeknight on call every two weeks. My client knows how demanding on-call work can be, so the rota ensures you receive the following day off after each on-call shift, plus generous time off in lieu for weekend work. There is also on-site accommodation available for anyone who prefers to stay over when on call. Part-time and flexible options are also available.<BR><BR>Overnight care is strongly supported by a team of dedicated night RVNs, including ECC certificate holders, which makes providing out-of-hours cover far more manageable and ensures excellent care for inpatients. An answering service takes night calls, so you won’t be handling the phone directly.<BR><BR>The practice is very well equipped, with digital x-ray, ultrasound, flexible and rigid endoscopy, two theatres with multiparameter monitoring, a dental suite with dental x-ray, an extensive in-house lab and separate dog and cat wards. They work closely with visiting specialists in ultrasonography and cardiology, meaning most cases can be worked up in-house.<BR><BR>The team includes vets and nurses with a wide range of certificates and special interests, so you’ll be surrounded by people who love sharing knowledge and supporting each other's development. As a training practice for both vet and nurse students, learning and progression are part of everyday life.<BR><BR>The benefits package is strong and includes 6.6 weeks’ holiday including Bank Holidays, a holiday buy-back scheme, paid volunteering leave, an Employee Assistance Programme, discounted gym membership, Cycle to Work scheme, enhanced family leave, private medical insurance options and generous CPD support with five paid CPD days (pro rata). Professional fees (RCVS, VDS and two more memberships) are covered, and colleagues’ pets receive treatment at cost.<BR><BR>If you’re looking to join a genuinely supportive team in Lancashire, where you can develop your interests, enjoy a varied caseload and feel valued at work, then get in touch!<BR>",
